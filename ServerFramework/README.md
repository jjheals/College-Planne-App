This directory contains all the files for the server's framework, including for Twilio SMS and the web API endpoints. For testing under the time constraints, security was considered but hard to implement. We also wish we could have made the code cleaner, easier to read and more efficient, but we aimed for functionality first. 

Each file has header comments describing the contents and purpose of the contents. The directory "ServerFramework" contains code solely for the backend API.
As we develop this app further, we plan to add more error checking, edge cases, input sterilization, authentication, and other security feautures to make the app more secure and functional. We recognize there is a LOT to improve on in the app as a whole, but especially the backend server's framework.
